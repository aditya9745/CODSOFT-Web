                <h3>Personal Finance Tracker</h3>

                <p>
                    <h4>Situation</h4>
                        Many individuals struggle with managing their personal finances. They may not have the necessary tools or knowledge to effectively budget and make informed financial decisions. Additionally, traditional personal finance software can be expensive and difficult to use.<br>

                    <h4>Task</h4>
                        To address this issue, I developed a Python program that allows individuals to easily manage their personal finances.<br>

                    <h4>Action</h4>
                        I utilized Python to create a user-friendly program that allows individuals to input their income and expenses, categorize their spending, and track their financial progress over time. The program includes a dashboard that displays the user's spending habits and provides tips for improving their finances.</p>

                <h3>Netflix Viewer Analytics and Prediction</h3>
                <img src="images/project2.jpg" alt="Project 2">
                <p>
                    <h4>Situation</h4>
                        Netflix generates an immense amount of data, including user preferences, viewing times, search histories, and ratings. However, turning this vast pool of data into actionable insights for content recommendations and viewership predictions can be a considerable challenge, especially due to the size and complexity of the data.<br>

                    <h4>Task</h4>
                        As the primary data analyst on this project, my aim was to construct a robust analytics pipeline using Python and Apache Spark, followed by an exploratory data analysis using SQL and a predictive model using linear regression. The goal was to develop a scalable process to handle large data volumes, clean, transform and load this data into a suitable format for a data warehouse, perform EDA, and ultimately create a prediction model..<br>

                    <h4>Action</h4>
                        The initial phase involved assessing the data from various sources, including Netflix's API and social media platforms. I then designed a suitable data model and used Python and Apache Spark to extract, clean, transform, and load the data into a data warehouse</p>
